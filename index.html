      <h1>Tokners is coming</h1> 
      <p>Cryptocurrency adoption is at less than 1% of the global world population with some<br> countries and entities actively fighting against its mass adoption and the smartest<br>developers and nerds holding the fort.</p> 
     <div class="bir">
      <b1 > Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of tokens launched all aiming<br> to fix one problem or the other with some quite simply FOMOing the moment. Our<br> goal is to bring mass adoption to the cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How<br>far down? So down that even a celebrity can explain it in simple words to their followers<br> and have them download an app, buy into the social currency of their favourite person<br> and watch their investment as is with other cryptocurrency project.<br><br> We are trying to do to this space what investment apps did for the "nonexistent retail<br> investors". We are gamefying digital currency, bringing in popular faces instead of hard<br>to understand projects to make it the norm and inadvertently being the "gateway drug"<br>for a lot of people to finally give this space a real look.</b1>
    </div>
    <p> A new digital economy is coming. People would be just as powerful as countries and<br> creators would be paid beyond the peanuts that conventional social media platforms<br> can offer. </p>
    <div class="ikki">
    <b1>There would be new markets and advertisers with little to offer would not find home<br>there. Like Kanye said, "Personalities would become the new currency, and services<br>would be built on top of them". Well, Kanye didn't exactly say that, but it sounds like<br>something we hope he would say.<br>Currency is digital, it has been that way for a while now, but this time there would be no<br> dead presidents on the money, there would people like you on the money, and you<br> would own it because it would make the most sense in the world.</b1>
